This post is aimed at those of you who *know* you should be using venvs for your one-off apartment-hunt screenscraper/fantasy football stat aggregator/\*gasp\* real work script but don't because, let's face it, the typical venv workflow is not as simple as it could be (was that `/Scripts/Activate.ps1` or `scripts/activate.ps1`??).
