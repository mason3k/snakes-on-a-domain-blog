## Welcome!

I'm a full-time Python developer with an English Literature degree. You do the math. No actually, please do the math for me. 

I'm constantly learning (and forgetting!) new things, so I created this blog to document tips, tools, programming jokes, and other 
things that make my day-to-day programming life more joyful.
